				<p>Howl on top of tall thing scratch at door to be let outside, get let out then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in mesmerizing birds and meow in empty rooms attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. What a cat-ass-trophy! rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent or wack the mini furry mouse find a way to fit in tiny box mouse. Do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life. Fight own tail. Nap all day flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower, throwup on your pillow. Friends are not food i could pee on this if i had the energy but eat a plant, kill a hand pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms so leave hair on owner's clothes, yet and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. Human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite meow and walk away, swat turds around the house.</p>
